# earlyLightCurvesReproduce

Can use the contents of this repository to reproduct the results of the simultions reported in our paper. Instructions on how to do so are below.

To reproduce the simulation of the collision dynamics run athena using the collision sim athinput and pgen file with the radIdeal eos set in spherical polar coordinates and on the fork located at https://zenodo.org/records/14768226. 

Once that is done the data can be processed
